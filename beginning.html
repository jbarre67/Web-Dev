            <p>The first web browser was invented in 1990 by Tim Berners-Lee during his time at
            CERN. This browser was initially named WorldWideWeb, but it was later renamed Nexus to
            avoid confusion with the World Wide Web itself (CERN 2023). These browsers were originally
            exclusive to NeXT computers, but after a few years of development, they were made available to
            users worldwide and served as a library for developers.</p>
